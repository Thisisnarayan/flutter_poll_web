  "mfQuestion3": "What is the minimum amount needed for investments?",
  "mfBody": "Mutual Fund Baskets are a combination of multiple mutual funds schemes created by India's top fund houses as per investor needs. Generally, no one buys just one mutual fund. mutual fund schemes in MFBs complement each other and try to deliver consistent returns across market cycles.",
  "mfBody1": "There are over 2,500 mutual funds schemes available in India. Often, investors buy similar mutual funds(multiple large cap funds or multiple sector-specific funds). In case of an adverse event, their entire portfolio might suffer. MFBs have been created in such a way that they attempt to deliver consistent returns across different market cycles.",
  "mfBody2": "India's top fund houses have created these baskets for multiple investment styles and needs, and they are available exclusively for Cherry investors.",
  "mfBody3": "MFB investments start as low as Rs. 1,000.",
